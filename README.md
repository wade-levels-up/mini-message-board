# mini-message-board

This is a project I completed as part of The Odin Project.

The objective of this project was to create a public message board where people could submit a message with a name of their choice. This project uses Railway (PaaS - Platform As A Service) to host the Express application as well as the PostgreSQL database it pulls data from.

Originally the project was created without a database and later on once I learnt enough about PostgreSQL I faced the challenege of integrating it alongside my original app.

Some of the challenges I faced with this project were understanding environment variables, seeding a remote database using a script and refactoring some of the original code to facilitate the data being stored (Specifically handling Dates and storing Dates in SQL).

Overall a very enjoyable project and it helped me consolidate my learnings
